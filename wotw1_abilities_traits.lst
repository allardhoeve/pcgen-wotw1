BENEFIT:You receive a +1 trait bonus to confirm critical hits.	COST:0

To be successfully tried for High Treason you have done more than merely dislike the king, you did something tangible to undermine his rule. Alas, that you failed at your plot and are now headed to Branderscar Prison. Treason is the only crime that is still punished by the gruesome ritual of being drawn and quartered.

To be sent to Branderscar Prison, this was no typical killing but a particularly savage and unforgiveable act. You may also have killed someone with powerful friends.

You receive a +1 trait bonus to Bluff checks and Bluff is always a class skill for you. Further if you ever take the Leadership feat, you gain a +1 trait bonus to your Leadership score.

However you ended up trading slaves in Talingarde, you were caught red handed and now you will lose more than simply your freedom. You receive one bonus skill point per level that must be spent on the Appraise skill. The Appraise skill is always a class skill for you.
